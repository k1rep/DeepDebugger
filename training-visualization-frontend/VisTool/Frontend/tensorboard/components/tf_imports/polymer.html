Without this, because of [1], JSCompiler omits the source from the output

<!-- [2]: HACK: Polymer2 (not 3) makes use of `super` in static methods which
gets wrongly replaced by Closure compiler. This causes Polymer critical libs to
misbehave and breaks application badly.
This import let Vulcanization skip future polymer/polymer.html statement and
allow us to use the hack only in one place.
Please see https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3240. -->
