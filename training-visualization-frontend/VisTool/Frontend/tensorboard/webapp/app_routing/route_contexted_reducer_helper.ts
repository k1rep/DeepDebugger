/**
 * @fileoverview Reducer helper for maintaining states that are are associated
 * with a routeId.
 *
 * Each TensorBoard experiment/compare view is regarded as a
 * separate instance of "app" where no states are shared. As a result, a run
 * selection in an experiment/1 should differ from experiment/2. This module
 * facilitates maintaining such states.
 *
 * The helper helps maintain the route-dependent (or routeful) states by
 * maintaining a dictionary of routeId to the route-dependent states. It
 * abstracts routes by, upon navigation, storing current route-dependent state
 * in the dictionary and reading/applying the state for the new route from the
 * dictionary. When the dictionary is empty, it applies the initialState. Client
 * can assume the values of the non-"private" top-level properties appropriately
 * combine the values for route-independent state with state for the active
 * route.
 *
 * Clients should never peek into or modify the property,
 * `privateRouteContextedState`.
 *
 * For discussion, please refer to docs/design/route-contexted-state.md.
